# jOOQ Plus

Several classes to enhance JOOQ and boost CRUD.

## Background

### Mybatis

Honestly, most Java programmers in China should have used [Mybatis 3](https://mybatis.org/mybatis-3/) and its enhanced libraries: [Mybatis Plus](https://baomidou.com/) or [tk.mybatis.mapper](https://github.com/abel533/Mapper) . These two enhanced libraries provide a layer of encapsulation on top of mybatis, using proxies to provide single-table CRUD methods without maintaining the SQL templates (both in the form of Java annotations and XML form). Users only need to inherit the base class , complete the development of single-table CRUD (**C**reate, **R**etrieve, **U**pdate, **D**elete and list, exists, count, etc.).

### jOOQ

[jOOQ](https://www.jooq.org/) and Mybatis are not essentially the same class of things: ([Different use cases and the technical difference and between MyBatis and jOOQ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62144011/different-use-cases-and-the-technical-difference-and-between-mybatis-and-jooq), [SQL Templating with jOOQ or MyBatis](https://blog.jooq.org/sql-templating-with-jooq-or-mybatis/)). I will not introduce the advantages and disadvantages of JOOQ here, nor will I say why you should use this and not use that. There is a lot of relevant information on the Internet.

Despite all the [documentation](https://www.jooq.org/doc/3.17/manual/code-generation/) and [Lukas Eder](https://github.com/lukaseder)(main maintainer of JOOQ community ) himself saying that JOOQ can work alone from the [code generator](https://www.jooq.org/doc/3.17/manual/code-generation/), after practicing in several companies, this would give us an inch. Even a requirement like getting the self-incrementing ID of the inserted data would be difficult to satisfy. If you are interested in JOOQ, I highly recommend that you use jOOQ's code generator in conjunction with a database DDL maintenance tool such as Flyway so that you can use 100% of JOOQ's capabilities. [I will show it in the test how to practice.](https://github.com/spencercjh/jooq-plus/issues/1)

### jOOQ Plus

Although no matter what library is used, CRUD Boy's job is still the same. We need to get CRUD done F A S T and focus on the actual business. When you use jOOQ, you will find:

1. jOOQ's [Dao](https://www.jooq.org/doc/latest/manual/sql-execution/daos/) lacks some necessary logic and is [too simple](https://github.com/jOOQ/jOOQ/issues/5984). Dao also cannot return the incremental ID of the new data: https://github.com/jOOQ/jOOQ/issues/13806. jOOQ's record has a CRUD-related API, but essentially the same as Dao: https://www.jooq.org/doc/latest/manual/sql-execution/crud-with-updatablerecords/simple-crud/.
2. You need to maintain things from a bunch of SQL (whatever Java and Annotation or XML) to a bunch of Java fluent API code, but they're still the same CRUD code.

**Essentially, we're just too lazy to maintain these code.You just have to write the code, you have to test them.It's tedious and boring.** 

## Overview

jOOQ Plus is very very very simple. It is made up of  a few interface and abstract implementation, designed to be similar to the Spring Data JPA [CrudRepository](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-commons/blob/main/src/main/java/org/springframework/data/repository/CrudRepository.java)(there it is: [BaseCrudRepository](https://github.com/spencercjh/jooq-plus/blob/main/lib/src/main/java/jooq/plus/BaseCrudRepository.java)) and [PagingAndSortingRepository](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-commons/blob/main/src/main/java/org/springframework/data/repository/PagingAndSortingRepository.java)(traced by https://github.com/spencercjh/jooq-plus/issues/5 and will be done recently).

In the implementation, I will make maximum use of Java generics and the code generated by the jOOQ code generator, rather than using proxies and reflection.

## RoadMap

- [Add Paging and sorting interface and abstract implementation](https://github.com/spencercjh/jooq-plus/issues/5)
- [Add complete test and example](https://github.com/spencercjh/jooq-plus/issues/1)
- [Add CI/CD (based on GitHub Actions)](https://github.com/spencercjh/jooq-plus/issues/4)
- [Support Multi-tables query](https://github.com/spencercjh/jooq-plus/issues/2)
